The "Data Anomaly Checker" is a desktop application designed to identify and report invalid data entries within a dataset. 
The app allows users to upload a CSV file and automatically performs a series of checks on specified columns, such as identifying non-text values, detecting entries exceeding specified lengths, and locating empty or null values. 
The results are displayed in a user-friendly interface with color-coded text boxes indicating the presence of anomalies. 
The app emphasizes the importance of non-empty cells by displaying a warning message and is designed with a simple, intuitive user experience in mind.
