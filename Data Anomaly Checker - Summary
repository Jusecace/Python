Summary of Functions for the Pembina Data Anomaly Checker
The Data Anomaly Checker is a desktop application designed to streamline the process of identifying and reporting data anomalies within a CSV file. Below is an organized explanation of the core functions it performs:

File Upload and Loading

Function: load_file
Description: This function allows users to upload a CSV file using a file dialog. It reads the file into a pandas DataFrame and updates the interface to display the filename and loaded data.
Data Anomaly Detection

Function: detect_invalid_in_column_x
Description: This is a generalized function template for detecting anomalies in specific columns. Each column has a customized version of this function tailored to its requirements (e.g., detect_invalid_in_column_0, detect_invalid_in_column_1, etc.). The anomalies detected include:
Non-text Values: Identifies entries that are not strings.
Exceed Length: Finds entries that exceed the specified character length.
Empty or Null Values: Detects empty or null entries, with specific handling for columns where empty values are allowed.
Updating the User Interface

Function: update_text_boxes
Description: Updates the text boxes in the UI with the indices of rows containing anomalies. Each type of anomaly has its dedicated text box, and a header value is displayed as well.
Color Coding and Warnings

Function: set_text_box_colors
Description: Sets the background color of text boxes to light red to highlight the presence of anomalies.
Warning Messages: A warning message is displayed indicating the importance of non-empty cells in specific columns.
User Interface Design

Tkinter Widgets: The app uses various Tkinter widgets to create the user interface, including labels, text boxes, buttons, and frames to organize the layout and functionality.
Customized Message: Displays a custom message created by the developer (e.g., "created by: Sebastian Cardenas") and a warning about empty cells.
Usage Flow
Launch the Application: The user starts the desktop application.
Upload CSV File: The user clicks on the "Load" button to upload a CSV file.
Data Processing: The uploaded file is processed, and each column is checked for anomalies using the specified detection functions.
Display Results: The results are displayed in text boxes with indices of rows containing anomalies. Text boxes with anomalies are highlighted in light red.
Warnings and Messages: A warning message about empty cells is displayed, and a custom message from the developer is shown at the top of the interface.
This organized functionality ensures that users can efficiently identify and address data anomalies in their datasets.
