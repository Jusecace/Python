Current Projects
1. Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024
This project analyzes the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset. Key objectives include:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values and converting data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating summary statistics and visualizing data distributions.
Trend Analysis: Identifying trends in release dates and popularity metrics.
Visualization: Creating scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts with trend lines.
Advanced Analysis: Calculating Interquartile Range (IQR) and implementing conditional counts.
Example code snippets and detailed explanations are provided to guide you through the analysis process.

2. Data Anomaly Checker
This project focuses on the "Data Anomaly Checker," a desktop application designed to identify and report invalid data entries within a dataset. Key objectives include:

File Upload and Loading: Allowing users to upload a CSV file using a file dialog. The file is read into a pandas DataFrame, and the filename and loaded data are displayed.
Data Anomaly Detection: Customized functions detect anomalies in specific columns, including non-text values, entries exceeding specified lengths, and empty or null values.
Updating the User Interface: Text boxes in the UI are updated with the indices of rows containing anomalies. Each type of anomaly has its dedicated text box, and a header value is displayed.
Color Coding and Warnings: Text boxes with anomalies are highlighted in light red. A warning message emphasizes the importance of non-empty cells in specific columns.
User Interface Design: The app uses various Tkinter widgets to create a user-friendly interface, including labels, text boxes, buttons, and frames to organize the layout and functionality. Custom messages from the developer are also displayed.
The application ensures efficient identification and addressing of data anomalies in user datasets.

Future Projects
This repository is a work in progress, and new projects will be added regularly.
